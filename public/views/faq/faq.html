        <h2>What is TheSolveBook?</h2>
        <p>
            TheSolveBook is an online message board. Users can create private boards, anonymously and for free. Boards can
            be shared with other users by their unique link or ID. Anyone who know the link to a board can read,
            write and edit messages on the board.
            The main objective of this application will be to share those problems that have already been solved
            by others and that have not been published freely on the internet, currently there are applications
            that help solve certain types of problems in Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, biology and others,
            however, these are limited and use is restricted to certain types of problems and have cost,
            thesolvebook will be free and accessible for all.
